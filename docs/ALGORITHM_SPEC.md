## 1. Problem definition

### 1.1 The general problem

Control a heat/cold source of **large thermal inertia** (water in a concrete screed, UFH) with
optional **fast convective assist** (air-to-air split) in selected rooms, so that each room holds
its target temperature in winter (heating) and summer (floor cooling).

**The slow source (UFH) is the priority.** Every room has UFH; not every room has a split. The
algorithm runs in both configurations, per room, fully independently.

| Source | Carrier | τ (time constant) | Role | Mandatory |
|--------|---------|-------------------|------|-----------|
| UFH (floor) | water in screed | **4–6 h** | base — slow, continuous, efficient | always |
| Split (air-to-air) | convection | **5–15 min** | boost — fast correction, costlier | optional per room |

The controller is **modular**: the core is per-room UFH regulation; fast-source coordination is an
optional layer activated per room (`fast_source_kind != NONE`). A room without a split still gets
the full benefit of PI + trend damping — it simply has no fast fallback when the slow loop lags.

### 1.2 Operating modes (one global house mode)

A single global house mode (`Mode` enum) drives every room; per room only the *control state*
(off / live — `off` maps to `Mode.OFF` in the core; the former `shadow` state was removed
2026-07-12, v0.7.0 — DECISIONS §13), *cooling participation* and *offset* differ.

| `Mode` | Valve | Fast source |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `HEATING` | PI-regulated `0..100 %`, holds setpoint | heating-only boost above `boost_offset_c` |
| `TRANSITIONAL` | **parked at 0** | bidirectional (heat below setpoint, cool above), split only |
| `COOLING` | PI-regulated (inverted sign) with dew-point throttle | cooling-only boost |
| `OFF` | 0, no regulation | OFF |

**Deadband:** when `|setpoint − T_room| ≤ deadband_c`, the PI error is zeroed (no integral growth)
and the split does not engage in any mode.

### 1.3 The cooling dew-point constraint

In floor cooling the cooled surface must never fall to the **dew point** or condensation ruins the
floor. This is the one case where **humidity is a critical measurement** — a humidity sensor is
required in every cooled room.

Magnus dew point (`tortoise_ufh.dew_point.dew_point`, coefficients `a = 17.625`, `b = 243.04`,
Alduchov & Eskridge 1996):

```
γ      = a·T_air/(b + T_air) + ln(RH/100)
T_dew  = b·γ / (a − γ)
```

Constraint: **T_surface ≥ T_dew + margin** (margin = 2 K). Enforced two ways (§7).

### 1.4 Cooling power asymmetry

Floor cooling has *less* power than floor heating (~30–40 W/m² vs ~50–80 W/m²) because of the
smaller ΔT between floor and air. The split at full power is unaffected. Consequence: in summer the
split is more active than in winter.

### 1.5 The pathology to avoid — priority inversion

If the split heats/cools a room within minutes → the thermostat is satisfied → the UFH valve closes
→ the screed loses temperature → the split runs non-stop as the *primary* source. COP collapses,
costs rise, the floor is dead.

**Countermeasure (Aneks §8.5, §8.7):** the floor is always the base and **is never closed just
because the split warmed/cooled the air**. The split only *adds* boost above `boost_offset_c` and
releases once inside the comfort band. The valve floor keeps the slow loop alive. See §8.

## 2. State of knowledge (condensed)

Coordinating a slow radiant source with a fast convective one is a mature HVAC problem: solved
commercially (Tekmar 557 — PWM on the slow source, stage 2 engages only at 100 % duty of stage 1;
Ekinex KNX — setpoint offset, fan-coil as auxiliary stage) and academically (hybridGEOTABS
two-layer MPC). Key takeaways relevant to a **PID-family** choice:

1. A **2nd-order model (2R2C) is enough** for control-grade prediction (Sourbron & Verhelst 2013);
   we use 3R3C in the simulator only, for a faithful digital twin.
2. **Simple heuristic rules approximate ~80 % of the optimum** — full MPC is not required to gain
   most of the benefit. Tortoise deliberately stops at PI + trend + feedforward.
3. **Overshoot is the main enemy** at high thermal mass — a reactive PI without inertia awareness
   overshoots badly; hence the explicit **trend-damping term** `−kt·(dT_room/dt)` (§5).
4. **Night setback is counterproductive** with a heavy screed.
5. The priority-inversion pathology (Tekmar Essay E006) is the central failure mode to design out.

Reference: `CONTROL_ALGORITHMS_REVIEW.md` (portable algorithm survey), which recommends the PID
family (cascade, anti-windup, feedforward/outdoor reset) as first-line for UFH.

## 3. Mathematical model (RC) — summary

The controller itself is **model-free** (it never sees `T_slab` and runs no RC model online). The
RC model lives only in the **simulator** (digital twin) as ground truth for offline PID tuning and
scenario tests. It is summarised here because it defines the plant the control law must tame.

### 3.1 RC network — electrical analogy

Temperature ↔ voltage, heat flow ↔ current, thermal resistance R [K/W] ↔ resistance, heat
capacity C [J/K] ↔ capacitor. Node equation:

```
C_j · dT_j/dt = Σ_h (T_h − T_j)/R_{h,j} + Q_j
```

### 3.2 3R3C minimal structure

State `x = [T_air, T_slab, T_wall]ᵀ`; SISO input `u = [Q_floor]`; disturbances
`d = [T_out, Q_sol, Q_int]ᵀ`.

```
C_air ·dT_air /dt = (T_slab−T_air)/R_sf + (T_wall−T_air)/R_wi + (T_out−T_air)/R_ve + Q_int + f_conv·Q_sol
C_slab·dT_slab/dt = (T_air−T_slab)/R_sf + (T_ground−T_slab)/R_ins + Q_floor
C_wall·dT_wall/dt = (T_air−T_wall)/R_wi + (T_out−T_wall)/R_wo + f_rad·Q_sol
```

The UFH heat `Q_floor` enters the **screed node only** — structurally far from the air node the
controller regulates. That distance (through `R_sf` and `C_slab`) *is* the inertia the trend term
fights.

### 3.3 Matrix form and discretisation

`ẋ = A_c x + B_c u + E_c d + b_c`, discretised by augmented-matrix ZOH via `scipy.linalg.expm`
(numerically stable for the stiff `C_slab/C_air ≈ 54:1` system):
`x[k+1] = A_d x + B_d u + E_d d + b_d`. Implemented in `tortoise_ufh.rc_model.RCModel`
(`ModelOrder.THREE`, SISO), used by `SimulatedRoom.step_with_power`.

### 3.4 Typical numeric values (20 m² room)

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `C_air` | ~60 kJ/K | air mass ρ·c·V |
| `C_slab` | ~3250 kJ/K | 80 mm screed (2300·880·0.08·20) |
| `C_wall` | 0.5–5 MJ/K | envelope mass |
| `R_sf` | ~0.01 K/W | floor→air convection |
| `R_ins` | 0.005–0.02 K/W | under-screed insulation |
| `R_ve` | 0.01–0.05 K/W | ventilation/infiltration |

`C_slab/C_air ≈ 54:1` — the source of the time-scale separation. Floor transfer function
`G_floor(s) ≈ K_f·e^(−θ·s)/[(τ₁s+1)(τ₂s+1)]` with `τ₁ ≈ 3–6 h`; split `G_conv(s) ≈ K_c/(τ_c s+1)`
with `τ_c ≈ 5–15 min`. Order (2nd vs 1st) and time-constant gap (hours vs minutes) are the
mathematical signature of the problem.

---

## 4. Control approaches — why PI + trend

Cascade PID (outer `T_room → T_slab`, inner `T_slab → valve`) is the classical answer but requires a
slab sensor and inverts the natural cascade (inner loop slower than outer). MPC (24 h horizon QP)
gives the best comfort/energy trade-off but needs an identified model, a state estimator and a
solver — explicitly **out of scope for v1** (Aneks §8.10).

Tortoise takes the pragmatic middle: **a single PI loop on the room-temperature error, plus an
explicit trend-damping term** that emulates the anticipatory value of derivative/predictive control
*without* differentiating the noisy error signal. This is the locked decision (Aneks §8.3): "single
PI loop on `T_room` error + trend term (`dT_room/dt`) damping overshoot; **no D term on the
error**; anti-windup; deadband; valve-floor."

---

## 5. The control law — PI + trend damping

Implemented in `tortoise_ufh.pid.PIDController` and `tortoise_ufh.controller.RoomController`. All
knobs come from `tortoise_ufh.config.ControllerConfig` (a frozen dataclass, `__post_init__`
`ValueError` validation). Defaults:

| Knob | Default | Unit | Role |
|------|---------|------|------|
| `kp` | 14.0 | %/K | proportional gain (retuned 2026-07-09, C1) |
| `ki` | 0.0015 | %/(K·s) | integral gain — Ti = kp/ki ≈ 2.6 h (retuned 2026-07-09) |
| `kd` | 0.0 | %·s/K | derivative (unused; **error D disabled**) |
| `kt` | 12.0 | %/(K/h) | **trend-damping gain**, applied to the FILTERED trend |
| `deadband_c` | 0.3 | K | comfort band |
| `valve_floor_pct` | 15.0 | % | minimum open when calling for heat |
| `outdoor_ff_enabled` | False | — | optional feedforward toggle |
| `ff_neutral_c` | 15.0 | °C | FF neutral outdoor temperature (knob since 2026-07-09) |
| `ff_gain_pct_per_k` | 1.0 | %/K | FF gain |
| `ff_max_pct` | 20.0 | % | FF cap |
| `boost_offset_c` | 1.0 | K | split engage threshold (must be > `deadband_c`) |
| `fast_min_on_minutes` | 10.0 | min | split min ON dwell |
| `fast_min_off_minutes` | 10.0 | min | split min OFF dwell |
| `dew_margin_k` | 2.0 | K | local S2 dew margin |
| `dew_ramp_k` | 2.0 | K | S2 graduated ramp width |
| `cycle_seconds` | 300.0 | s | control cycle (= PID `dt`) |
| `valve_write_threshold_pct` | 2.0 | % | HA write dead-zone |

> **Why the 2026-07-09 retune (C1, DECISIONS §8):** the original `ki = 0.02` meant
> Ti ≈ 7 min against a τ = 3–6 h slab — the integrator saturated during every approach and the
> measured closed-loop result was **+1.2 K overshoot with a ±0.6 K limit cycle**. The new
> defaults were chosen by an empirical sweep on the CALIBRATED digital twin (solar wired, EN
> 1264^1.1 plant, realistic ground): overshoot ≤ +0.2 K, 24–48 h tail 100 % inside ±0.3 K,
> ~1 pp/h valve travel. Full sweep table in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §8.

### 5.1 Error sign convention

Report always uses the **heating convention** `error_c = setpoint − T_room`. Internally a
"need-more-actuation" error is derived so a positive error always means "open more":

```
heating:  error = setpoint − T_room ;  trend_toward = +dT_room/dt
cooling:  error = T_room − setpoint ;  trend_toward = −dT_room/dt
```

### 5.2 Trend estimate — FILTERED (S10, 2026-07-09)

```
# accumulate elapsed time; take a raw sample only once >= 60 s has passed
raw   = (T_room − T_room_at_last_sample) / accumulated_hours    # [K/h]
alpha = 1 − exp(−accumulated_dt / 900 s)                         # EMA, tau = 15 min
trend = trend + alpha · (raw − trend)                            # 0 on the first call
```

`RoomController` stores the temperature at the last accepted sample and the filtered trend
between calls. Two protections (S10): **(1) the 60 s floor** — a debounced recompute ~2 s after
a setpoint change HOLDS the previous filtered value instead of dividing a 0.1 K sensor tick by
2 s (a fictitious 180 K/h); shorter intervals accumulate until the floor is reached; **(2) the
15 min EMA** — σ = 0.1 K of sensor noise creates raw trend noise on the order of the true
signal, and unfiltered it converted the (deliberately one-sided) damping term into actuator
wear and a downward bias. Sensor loss resets the filter (a gap invalidates the trend).
`dt_seconds` is the *actual* elapsed time passed to `step` (monotonic, clamped `[1, 900]` s).

### 5.3 Deadband (sign-preserving magnitude reduction)

```
error_db = sign(error) · max(0, |error| − deadband_c)
```

Inside the band `error_db = 0`, so the PI integral does not grow — and the valve **rests at the
accumulated integral** (plus trend/FF terms). It does NOT decay toward the floor/0: the resting
integral is the steady-state heat demand, and bleeding it off inside the band would saw-tooth
the room (control-F7 clarification, 2026-07-09).

### 5.4 Discrete PI with back-calculation anti-windup

`PIDController.compute(error_db, dt_seconds=dt_seconds, freeze_integrator=freeze)` (backward
Euler at the per-call `dt`; falls back to the configured `dt = cycle_seconds` when the caller
does not pass one):

```
P     = kp · e
rate  = ki · unwind_factor if e·I < 0 else ki   # asymmetric unwind (K1, 2026-07-12)
I    += rate · e · dt        # skipped when freeze_integrator is True
D     = kd · (e − e_prev)/dt # 0 on first call; kd = 0 in v1 so D ≡ 0
u_raw = P + I + D
u     = clip(u_raw, output_min, output_max)     # [0, 100]
if ki > 0:  I += (u − u_raw)                     # back-calculation anti-windup
```

Validation (`__init__`): `kp, ki, kd ≥ 0`, `dt > 0`, `output_min < output_max`,
`unwind_factor ≥ 1`; `compute` raises on a non-positive `dt_seconds`.

**Asymmetric unwind (K1, 2026-07-12):** while the (deadbanded) error OPPOSES the accumulated
integral — stale knowledge from a previous operating point, e.g. a heating integral above a
freshly lowered setpoint — the integral discharges `unwind_factor` (8 in the room controller)
times faster than it accumulated. The accelerated step only ever pulls `I` toward zero, and
inside the comfort band `e = 0`, so equilibrium and steady-state behaviour are untouched.

**Bumpless setpoint transfer (K1, 2026-07-12):** a change of the effective setpoint by `dK`
between PID-active cycles in the same mode calls `pid.shift_integral(kp · d_err)`
(`d_err = dK` heating / `−dK` cooling, clamped to the output range): the integral — the loop's
memory of the operating point — moves WITH the setpoint instead of discharging the difference
at `ki` speed. Measured on the twin (23 → 21 °C at a saturated integral): active heating of an
already-too-warm room fell from 17.4 h (642 %·h) to 0.8 h (23 %·h), the return to the band got
FASTER (35 h vs 49 h), at the cost of a deeper coast-down trough (−0.92 K vs −0.54 K).

All time-dependent pieces share ONE time base: the PI integral, the trend (§5.2) and the
fast-source dwell timers (§8.2) all use the measured `dt_seconds` passed to
`RoomController.step` (the coordinator measures it monotonically and clamps to [1, 900] s).
This keeps the integral honest when steps are irregular — an immediate debounced recompute
~2 s after a setpoint change accumulates ~2 s of integral, not a full nominal 300 s cycle.

### 5.5 Integrator freeze + seasonal hygiene (extended 2026-07-09, S1/S2)

`freeze = (inputs.hp_active_for_ufh is False) or (COOLING and dew_factor < 1.0)`:

* **DHW/defrost** — the heat pump is not serving UFH, so the integral must not wind up against
  an inactive source.
* **Active S2 dew throttle (S1/dew-F2)** — the throttle multiplies the valve AFTER the PI,
  invisibly to the back-calculation anti-windup; without the freeze, hours of throttled cooling
  banked an integral that slammed the valve to ~100 % the moment the humidity cleared. The
  factor is computed before the PI (it depends only on inputs) and applied after it.

P (and D) still act; anti-windup back-calc still applies. Two further hygiene rules (S2):
a **HEATING↔COOLING transition resets the integrator** (the error convention flips — one
season's integral is anti-knowledge for the other), and **> 12 h of accumulated inactivity**
(OFF / TRANSITIONAL / cooling opt-out / sensor lost) clears it, so the last winter integral is
never the first cooling command.

*(K9, 2026-07-12.)* The throttle-freeze was re-examined against a back-calculation from the
FINAL (throttled) valve (`I += u_final − u_raw` per throttled cycle) and the freeze STAYS: any
tracking anti-windup enforces `u_raw ≈ u_final`, pinning the integral at ~0 for the whole
episode, so the measured post-release catch-up was not faster (±0.3 K after 8.6 h either way
following 6 h of full throttle; 9.5 h — worse — for a partial throttle), and under a persistent
partial throttle the tracking variant suppresses the legitimate integral entirely. The catch-up
time is a `ki`-speed property (the integral must honestly rebuild), not a windup artifact.

### 5.6 Trend damping — the inertia tamer

The key anti-overshoot member ("człon trendu"). When the room is moving *toward* setpoint the valve
is pre-emptively reduced in proportion to the rate of approach:

```
trend_damp = kt · max(0, trend_toward)     # only damp motion toward setpoint
trend_term = − trend_damp
valve      = pid_out + trend_term
```

Clamping `trend_toward` at 0 means the term never *adds* actuation when the room is drifting away —
it only bleeds off actuation as the heavy floor closes on the target, absorbing the pipeline of heat
already stored in the screed. This is the single most important overshoot control for a 4–6 h τ
plant.

### 5.7 Optional outdoor feedforward

If `outdoor_ff_enabled` and an outdoor temperature is present, a small bounded baseline is added
(`RoomController._feedforward`): heating → colder outside raises the baseline; cooling → hotter
outside raises it. Directional: `deviation = max(0, ff_neutral_c − T_out)` in heating,
`max(0, T_out − ff_neutral_c)` in cooling; `ff = min(ff_max_pct, ff_gain_pct_per_k · deviation)`.
The shaping constants are `ControllerConfig` knobs since 2026-07-09 (control-F6; previously
module constants). The PI does the real work; this only shortens the transient. We never command
supply temperature — that is the heat pump's job.

### 5.8 Valve floor (heating only)

When heating and still calling for heat (`error_db > 0`):

```
if valve < valve_floor_pct:  valve = valve_floor_pct ;  valve_floor_applied = True
```

Keeps a trickle of flow through the loop (anti priority-inversion + keeps the screed charged). Not
applied in cooling/off/transitional or once satisfied.

### 5.9 Clamp and saturation

```
saturated = (valve ≤ 0) or (valve ≥ 100)      # measured on the pre-clamp value
valve     = clip(valve, 0, 100)
raw_valve_pct  = pre-floor / pre-dew / pre-clamp value   # recorded in the report
```

### 5.10 Worked step (heating)

`setpoint = 21`, `T_room = 20.6`, sustained climb `+2.4 K/h` (filtered trend has converged),
`dt = 300 s`, current defaults (`kp = 14`, `kt = 12`):
`error = +0.4`; `error_db = 0.4−0.3 = 0.1`; `P = 14·0.1 = 1.4`;
`trend_damp = 12·2.4 = 28.8` → `trend_term = −28.8`; `valve = pid_out − 28.8`, clamped ≥ 0 and
then floored to `15 %` (still calling for heat). The rapidly warming floor is throttled back
toward the floor minimum well before it reaches setpoint.

---

## 6. Per-room algorithm (the 15 steps)

`RoomController.step(inputs: RoomInputs, *, dt_seconds=300.0) -> RoomOutputs`. Order (matches the
code exactly):

1. **Missing room temp** (`room_temperature_c is None`) → safe degrade (§9): HEATING holds the
   last valve; COOLING/TRANSITIONAL/OFF park the valve at 0 (2026-07-09 — freeze-open in cooling
   would bypass both condensation defences); split OFF, flag `"sensor_lost"`, no PI.
2. **`Mode.OFF`** → valve 0, split OFF, report "off".
3. **`Mode.TRANSITIONAL`** → valve parked at 0; split only, bidirectional on error sign (subject to
   `boost_offset_c` and the dwell timers).
4. **Filtered trend** (§5.2, S10 2026-07-09): raw sample only after ≥ 60 s accumulated, then a
   15 min EMA; a fast recompute holds the previous value.
5. **Error** in need-more-actuation convention (§5.1); a HEATING↔COOLING transition resets the
   integrator here (§5.5).
6. **Deadband** (§5.3).
7. **Integrator freeze** (§5.5): DHW/defrost OR an active S2 dew throttle (`dew_factor < 1`,
   computed here from the inputs, applied in step 12).
8. **PI compute** → `pid_out` (§5.4).
9. **Trend damping** (§5.6).
10. **Optional feedforward** (§5.7).
11. **Valve floor**, heating only (§5.8).
11b. **Cooling boost-hold** (§8.5) — while the split is ENGAGED in cooling, `valve = max(valve,
    _boost_hold_pct)` (a floor, never a clamp); HEATING is untouched.
12. **Cooling local dew throttle (S2)** (§7.2) — applies the factor computed in step 7 to the
    (possibly held) valve.
13. **Clamp + saturation** (§5.9). A zero produced solely by the S2 throttle does NOT set
    `saturated` (control-F8, 2026-07-09): `saturated` means "the PI hit a 0/100 bound";
    `dew_throttle_factor` carries the condensation story.
14. **Fast-source coordination** (§8).
15. **Build `RoomReport`** — every term filled + a concise human/AI explanation string.

Three refinements around the numbered list:

- **Cooling opt-out (between steps 4 and 5):** a `COOLING` room with `cooling_enabled=False`
  never runs the cooling PI — it returns early with the valve parked at 0, the fast source OFF
  and the flag `"cooling_disabled"` (an opted-out room must never receive chilled water, which
  would bypass both condensation defences of §7).
- **Hard-safety override (after step 15, every path incl. safe degrade):** the stateful
  `tortoise_ufh.safety.SafetyEvaluator` (rules S1–S5, per-rule hysteresis carried across cycles)
  is fed the governing loop supply (hottest loop in heating / coldest in cooling), room
  temperature, humidity AND the per-room data age (`RoomInputs.last_update_age_minutes`,
  adapter-supplied — S6 2026-07-09); the water side and the air side are decided independently
  across the active rules and merged into the report flags. `FALLBACK_HP_CURVE` (S5) alone
  commands the NEUTRAL position — `valve_floor_pct` in heating, 0 in cooling — deferring to the
  heat pump's own curve; the adapter's building-level watchdog stays report-only (§9).
- **Additive report stamping (last):** `dew_excluded_reason` (from `classify_dew_eligibility`,
  §7.1) and `fast_dwell_remaining_s` (§8.2) are stamped onto the final post-safety report, so the
  dwell value reflects the final fast-source state (a safety force-off clears it).

`RoomOutputs = {valve_position_pct, fast_source: FastSourceCommand, report: RoomReport}`. All I/O
types are frozen dataclasses in `tortoise_ufh.models` with JSON `to_dict()` helpers (enums → their
`.value`) consumed by the HA websocket and panel. The report additionally echoes the measured
`room_temperature_c` (`None` on sensor loss) so consumers never reconstruct the measurement from
`setpoint − error_c`.

## 7. Cooling and two-layer dew-point protection

Floor cooling is in scope for v1 (Aneks §8.4). Cooling runs the same PI with inverted sign (§5.1);
condensation protection is **defense-in-depth**, two independent layers.

### 7.1 Layer 1 — global safe dew point (exposed value, primary)

Computed by `BuildingController.step`. Over rooms that are `COOLING`, `cooling_enabled`, and have a
usable `T_room` and `humidity_pct`:

```
T_dew_i             = dew_point(T_room_i, RH_i)                 # Magnus
global_safe_dew_c   = max_i(T_dew_i) + 2 K                       # None if no eligible room
```

Exposed as a global sensor entity (`BuildingOutputs.global_safe_dew_point_c`). **The module does not
control water** — the owner pipes this value to the heat pump as the cooling-supply lower limit.
Because it is a *maximum over rooms + fixed margin*, it never lowers on any single room's behalf.
Margin constant: `controller.GLOBAL_SAFE_DEW_MARGIN_K = 2.0`.

Eligibility is decided by the pure helper `controller.classify_dew_eligibility(RoomInputs)` — the
single source of truth with two consumers: `BuildingController._eligible_dew_point` (a `None`
return means "eligible, feeds the maximum") and `RoomController.step`, which records the result in
`RoomReport.dew_excluded_reason` (`None`, or one of `"not_cooling_mode"` / `"cooling_disabled"` /
`"no_temperature"` / `"no_humidity"`) so the panel can explain *why* the global safe dew point is
`None`.

### 7.2 Layer 2 — local S2 valve throttle (per room, secondary)

Independent of the heat pump. Runs only in `COOLING` with `cooling_enabled`
(`RoomController._cooling_throttle`):

```
T_dew        = dew_point(T_room, RH)
t_supply_min = min(loop.supply_temperature_c for loop in inputs.loops if present)
factor       = cooling_throttle_factor(t_supply_min, T_dew,
                                       margin=dew_margin_k, ramp=dew_ramp_k)   # ∈ [0, 1]
valve       *= factor
```

`cooling_throttle_factor` (in `dew_point.py`), with `gap = t_supply_min − T_dew` and
`lo = max(0, margin − ramp)` *(semantics REVISED 2026-07-12, K6 — owner decision "tylko pompa
+2"; see DECISIONS §11)*:

```
gap ≥ margin            → 1.0   (fully open — full cooling exactly on the pump's dew floor)
gap ≤ lo                → 0.0   (fully throttled; with the defaults: supply at the room's dew)
otherwise               → (gap − lo)/(margin − lo)   (graduated linear ramp BELOW the margin)
```

The heat pump's global `dew_max + 2 K` supply floor (Layer 1) is the system's ONE working
margin; the local ramp now ENDS at that design gap instead of stacking a second margin above
it. Before this revision the ramp spanned `(margin, margin + ramp)`: the most humid room — the
one defining the pump floor — sat at `gap = margin` with `factor = 0`, and `hot_july` measured
"fasadowe" cooling (valves open 29.7 % of records, living room ~2.7 K above the setpoint);
after the change the valves are open 94.2 % of records with the minimum slab-dew margin still
at +1.51 K. A STALE humidity reading (held 60-120 min, K7) pads the effective dew point by
`RoomInputs.humidity_stale_frac * 1 K` — the fraction rises linearly 0 → 1 across the 60-120 min
age window (linearised 2026-07-12, D5/R3, replacing the boolean field: the binary +1 K jump at
the 60-min edge stepped the throttle factor by 0.5 in one cycle, itself a mini limit cycle) —
and flags `"rh_stale_gated"` whenever the fraction is positive.

**Conservative on missing data:** if humidity is missing/non-positive *or* no loop supply reading is
available, `factor = 0.0` and the flag `"s2_throttle"` is raised — better a warm room than a wet
floor. `factor == 0` also raises the flag. (Renamed from `"s2_condensation"` 2026-07-12, B7 —
that name now belongs exclusively to the independent hard-safety rule, which itself moved BELOW
the ramp: `S2_HARD_MARGIN_K = 0`, trip at `supply < dew`, clear at `gap > +1 K` — a backstop
behind a backstop.)

### 7.3 Why two layers

Layer 1 keeps the *whole* water circuit above the worst room's dew point (prevents the pump ever
delivering condensing water). Layer 2 protects a single room whose local humidity spiked (a shower,
a cracked window) even if the global limit was still nominally safe, and does so without waiting a
5-minute cycle for the pump to react. Either layer alone is sufficient for safety; together they are
belt-and-braces (Aneks §8.4). This is distinct from the independent hard-safety module
`tortoise_ufh.safety` (rules S1–S5), which is a separate last line of defence.

## 8. Fast-source coordination and anti priority-inversion

Only when `fast_source_kind != NONE`. Command shape (`FastSourceCommand`): `on` +
`mode ∈ {HEATING, COOLING, OFF}` + `target_temperature_c` (S12, 2026-07-09: `setpoint + offset`
while HEATING / `setpoint - offset` while COOLING — the `fast_target_offset_k` tuning knob since
2026-07-13, default 1 K, `0` disables, previously the fixed `FAST_TARGET_OFFSET_K`; exactly
`setpoint` in TRANSITIONAL regardless of the knob). We set the split's own setpoint and mode (`climate.set_hvac_mode` +
`climate.set_temperature`); we never touch compressor power — the split self-regulates. The
adapter caches the last written `(hvac_mode, target)` per entity and re-sends only on change or
after a ~45-min re-assert (S3).

### 8.1 Engage / release (hysteresis) + the direction machine (C6, 2026-07-09)

The direction is **machine state** (`_fast_state ∈ {OFF, HEATING, COOLING}`), never a per-cycle
computation. `RoomController._want_fast(demand, engaged=...)` where `demand` is the
need-more-actuation error in the requested direction:

```
if engaged in THIS direction:  stay ON while  demand > deadband_c   (release inside comfort band)
else:                          turn ON  when  demand > boost_offset_c
```

Transitions: `OFF → direction` requires the full min-OFF; `running → OFF` (requested OFF **or the
opposite direction**) requires the full min-ON — a HEATING↔COOLING reversal is only reachable
through OFF with the full min-OFF dwell (indoor units may share a multisplit outdoor unit). A
blocked request re-emits the REMEMBERED direction. In TRANSITIONAL a running split releases only
past the FAR edge of the comfort band (`demand < -deadband_c`) — while ON it self-regulates at
`target = setpoint`, which removes the old below-setpoint bias band (S12).

### 8.2 Min ON / min OFF (compressor protection) + physical sync (S4)

`_decide_fast_source` advances an internal dwell timer by `dt_seconds` and permits a state change
only when the relevant minimum dwell (`fast_min_on_minutes` / `fast_min_off_minutes`) has elapsed;
otherwise the flag `"fast_source_min_runtime"` is raised and the previous state is held. The timer
also accumulates on sensor-lost/OFF forced paths (fast-F6), so a long outage counts toward the
min-OFF wait. Rooms without a physical feedback (`fast_source_on is None`) seed the timer large
(`_INITIAL_FAST_TIMER_S`) so the very first transition is never blocked; the FIRST observed
feedback wins over the machine (running unit adopted as ON, stopped as OFF) and re-seeds the timer
conservatively to 0 — a full dwell after every restart/reload, so a restart loop cannot
short-cycle a compressor. Later feedback disagreeing with the previous cycle's command raises the
additive `"fast_source_mismatch"` flag. The seconds
left on the *current* state's lock (min ON while running, min OFF while idle) are surfaced as
`RoomReport.fast_dwell_remaining_s` (`None` once elapsed, when there is no fast source, or after a
safety force-off); the panel renders it as "unlocks in ~N min".

### 8.3 Anti priority-inversion (the core invariant)

**The split decision NEVER reduces or holds the valve.** In the code the valve is fully computed
(steps 8–13) *before* and *independently of* the fast-source decision (step 14). The split only
*adds* boost above `boost_offset_c` and releases once inside the comfort band; the valve floor keeps
the slow loop charged. There is no path by which "the split satisfied the air" closes the floor —
structurally eliminating the Tekmar E006 pathology (§1.5). `_force_fast_off` bypasses the min-ON
timer for safety conditions (lost sensor, OFF mode).

### 8.4 Multisplit group arbiter (K4 2026-07-12; incumbent hysteresis K2/R3 2026-07-12)

Rooms sharing a non-empty `RoomInputs.fast_source_group` (one physical outdoor unit) are
direction-arbitrated by `BuildingController._arbitrate_fast_groups` after every room has
stepped — ONE direction per group per cycle. Resolution order for a group whose emitted ON
commands disagree:

1. **Pinning** — a unit ON and still inside its min-ON dwell (or held ON by an S3/S4
   emergency) pins the group to its direction; the arbiter never breaks a min-ON. Two
   opposite pins (pathological startup adoption) override nobody; everyone is flagged.
2. **Incumbent hysteresis (K2, R3 2026-07-12)** — the incumbent direction is the one a unit
   was ALREADY physically running in at step entry, falling back to the group's stored last
   winner when every conflicting unit re-engaged from OFF this cycle. The challenger takes
   over only when its best comfort-band excess `max(0, |error| − deadband)` exceeds the
   incumbent side's best excess by MORE than the fixed `_GROUP_CHALLENGER_HYSTERESIS_K =
   0.5 K` (not a config knob). Measured motivation: two rooms with persistent opposite ~2 K
   demands plus σ = 0.05 K sensor noise reversed the aggregate direction 15× in 2.5 h at
   zero dwells (7× at the default 10/10 min) under the bare max-excess rule; with the
   hysteresis: 0 reversals, while a genuinely stronger challenger (> +0.5 K) still wins.
3. **Tie-break with no incumbent** — the direction of the single room with the **largest
   comfort-band excess** wins (documented explicitly, D8/R3: the tie-break is deliberately
   the strongest single room, NOT the side head-count — one room 3 K outside its band
   outweighs two rooms 0.5 K outside; head-count would let several barely-uncomfortable
   rooms strangle one badly-uncomfortable one).

Losers are rewritten OFF (`RoomController.resolve_group_conflict`) with the
`fast_source_group_conflict` flag and re-engage only through a full min-OFF. The stored
last-winner map is cleared by `BuildingController.reset()`. **The adapter empties
`fast_source_group` for every non-LIVE room (K1, R3 2026-07-12; reduced 2026-07-12 v0.7.0):**
an OFF room is fed `Mode.OFF` and never writes, but its direction machine (with dwell
timers) still exists — the emptied group keeps it from voting in or dwell-pinning the
arbitration (belt and braces). Historically K1 guarded the since-removed `shadow` state,
whose uncontrolled error used to strangle the LIVE rooms' split.

### 8.5 Cooling boost-hold — anti priority-inversion on the MEASUREMENT path (P2, 2026-07-13)

§8.3 guarantees the split's *command* never lowers the floor. But there is a subtler leak on the
*measurement* path in COOLING: once the split engages it cools the air, so the room error (and the
filtered trend) fall toward zero, the cooling PI + trend damper retreat, and the floor valve
collapses to 0 — the split has *indirectly* strangled the base floor source, exactly when the
slab most needs discharging. The consequences are wasted slab-discharge capacity during the boost
and, when the split releases, an air that rebounds off the still-warm mass and short-cycles the
compressor.

The fix (step 11b) closes that leak with a **hold-not-close floor**: while a room is in
`Mode.COOLING` **and its split was ENGAGED at step entry** (`_fast_entry_state is
FastSourceMode.COOLING` — a one-cycle-delayed witness the slab's thermal mass absorbs), the floor
valve is pinned at a snapshot of the raw (pre-throttle, clamped) valve it held the cycle the split
engaged:

```
boost = (mode is COOLING) and (fast_entry_state is COOLING)
if boost:
    if _boost_hold_pct is None: _boost_hold_pct = _last_raw_valve_pct   # snapshot on the edge
    valve = max(valve, _boost_hold_pct)                                 # a FLOOR, not a clamp
```

Rationale: *since the boost only engaged because the floor alone could not cope, the split cannot
be the reason the floor retreats.* Ordering is load-bearing — the hold is applied **before** the S2
dew throttle (step 12) and **below** the hard-safety layer (post step 15): the throttle still scales
the held value (`dew_factor = 0` still closes the valve), sensor-loss still parks it at 0, and the
**global safe dew point (§7.1) is never touched** — the hold only ever raises *flow* at an
already-safe supply temperature, so it is condensation-neutral (verified on the twin: the worst
slab-vs-dew margin is identical with and without the hold). `max()` lets the PI push HIGHER, never
lower. The snapshot is per-engagement (`_boost_hold_pct` cleared on release, mode change and every
inactive cycle) and not persisted across a restart — a lost snapshot merely reverts one engagement
to the old behaviour until the next engage edge. No new tuning knob, no new report field, no change
to HEATING (the `Mode.COOLING` guard is explicit). Deliberately minimal: freezing the integrator
and suppressing the trend damper during boost were evaluated and dropped as redundant — the `max()`
floor already dominates the PI/trend and the twin showed no post-release integrator collapse (see
docs/DECISIONS.md §18).

## 9. Safe degradation

| Condition | Behaviour | Flag |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Room temp lost (`None`) | HEATING: **hold last valve position** of healthy regulation (cold-start init `valve_floor_pct`); COOLING/TRANSITIONAL/OFF: **valve 0** — never freeze-open in cooling (2026-07-09, both condensation layers need `T_room`); split **OFF**, no PI | `sensor_lost` |
| `Mode.OFF` | valve 0, split OFF | — |
| `COOLING` with `cooling_enabled=False` | valve 0 (never floor-cool an opted-out room), split OFF, no PI | `cooling_disabled` |
| Missing humidity / supply in cooling | S2 `factor → 0` (conservative close) | `s2_throttle` |
| Humidity held 60-120 min old (K7, 2026-07-12; linear D5/R3) | effective dew point + `frac * 1 K` in both layers (frac 0 → 1 across the age window) | `rh_stale_gated` |
| Split change blocked by dwell timer | hold previous split state | `fast_source_min_runtime` |
| Split lost the multisplit group arbitration (K4, 2026-07-12) | fast OFF (honest min-OFF before re-engaging) | `fast_source_group_conflict` |
| HEATER-kind fast source asked to cool | fast source forced OFF (a heater never cools) | `fast_source_cannot_cool` |
| Room has no controller (orchestrator) | valve 0, split OFF | `unknown_room` |
| Room controller raised | HEATING: hold last valve; COOLING/TRANSITIONAL/OFF: valve 0 (K5, 2026-07-12 — a crashed controller computes neither condensation defence); split OFF | `controller_error` |
| Per-room data age > 15 min (S5, 2026-07-09) | **neutral position**: `valve_floor_pct` in heating / 0 in cooling (defer to the HP curve), split OFF; clears below 5 min | `s5_watchdog` |
| Loop commanded open but no hydraulic response (S6, 2026-07-13) | integrator **frozen**; `binary_sensor.flow_fault` on; no valve action | `loop_no_flow` |

### 9.1 Hydraulic no-flow watchdog (S6, 2026-07-13)

The data path (age gates, plausibility, `valve_mismatch`) cannot catch a `valve` entity
that **echoes the commanded position back as feedback** — a real production failure mode
(issue #4: both controllers froze after a reboot yet reported obedience; 2.5 h of LIVE
cooling with a frozen-open loop outside both condensation guards). S6 (pure core
`flow_watchdog.py`) uses the per-loop `entity_supply` / `entity_return` probes as an
INDEPENDENT physical witness and **never reads the valve feedback**.

```
flow_signature = |T_supply − T_return| ≥ flow_epsilon_k
                 OR T_supply displaced toward the source side (cooling: down, heating: up)
circulation_evident = any OTHER loop shows a healthy ΔT
                      OR entity_global_supply reads source-side          # else HOLD (no accrual)
loop_no_flow    : cmd ≥ flow_open_threshold_pct for ≥ flow_response_window_min,
                  circulation_evident, and NOT flow_signature            → freeze integrator
```

(The former stuck-open reverse detection — a closed COOLING valve suspected of
leaking because the room stayed below setpoint — was removed 2026-07-13; its room-air witness
could not hard-verify actuation. See docs/DECISIONS.md §17.)

The window starts on the SECOND cycle (the first sets the reference), so the flag lands
within one window + one cycle. The RETURN probe is weighted over supply (supply may sit on
the manifold bar before the valve). Rooms without probes: inactive (`—`). Reaction is
PASSIVE — flag + `binary_sensor.flow_fault` (device class PROBLEM) + integrator freeze;
never an automatic valve move. The `entity_global_supply` evidence path is **suspended
while any room reports `hp_active_for_ufh is False`** (DHW/defrost) — a manifold probe can
read source-side while UFH loops are legitimately starved, so it would otherwise bank
no-flow windows on healthy loops; the per-loop witness path needs no guard (the other loops
are not flowing either → HOLD). The manual
`tortoise_ufh.test_actuation` service drives one room's valve to 100 % for 20–30 min and
reads the probe response (`actuation_test_running` / `actuation_test_failed`), gated by the
condensation/overheat safety rules and the room being LIVE with probes.

`BuildingController.step` never raises on a single room: it catches `(ValueError, ArithmeticError)`
per room and substitutes a degraded `RoomOutputs`; it also counts the currently degraded rooms
into `BuildingOutputs.sensor_lost_rooms` (2026-07-09, safety-F13 — a building-level staleness
counter surfaced via websocket, not a new entity). A **watchdog** (HA adapter): no fresh data
> 15 min → emergency/alarm state in the report (recovery after 5 min); report-only — the
per-room actuator escalation belongs to S5 above. The module is the *sole
owner* of participating rooms' valves and splits; externally there is only the global mode, the
per-room control state (off / live), and the water-side owner (heat pump / DHW). A room in
**off** (core fed `Mode.OFF`) → compute + report but emit **no**
commands; only a **live** room writes. A whole-home stop is every room off (the per-room
control state replaced the earlier global kill-switch in v2; the third `shadow` state was
removed in v0.7.0 — DECISIONS §13). Floor protection without a slab sensor
relies on the supply-water temperature proxy (safety rules S1/S2) plus conservative valve ranges.

## 10. Simulator and test strategy

### 10.1 Digital twin (mirror of pump-ahead §4)

- `RCModel` (3R3C ZOH via `expm`) is ground truth; `SimulatedRoom` owns the thermal state
  `_x = model.reset()` and applies `valve_pct` + finite HP power; `BuildingSimulator` orchestrates
  time and distributes finite HP power via `ufh_loop.loop_power` (EN 1264, returns 0 on wrong
  gradient — Axiom-3-safe).
- `BuildingSimulator.get_all_measurements()` produces the **same `dict[str, RoomInputs]`** the HA
  coordinator builds, so `BuildingController.step` is called *identically* in tests and in HA.
- **`T_slab` is ground truth inside the sim and is NOT placed into `RoomInputs`** — the controller
  must not see it (Aneks §8.9). The log records it for metrics/plots only.
- `SensorNoise` (seeded `np.random.default_rng`) corrupts only the measurement snapshot (`T_room`,
  optionally supply), never the physics.

### 10.2 Three test layers

1. **Unit (TDD, `-m unit`, seed 42):** `PIDController` convergence and anti-windup (plus the K1
   `shift_integral` / `unwind_factor` contracts); deadband sign-preservation; trend-damping
   arithmetic (incl. the kt sign canary — see §10.3 note); `dew_point` vs psychrometric tables;
   `cooling_throttle_factor` boundaries (K6: `gap ≥ margin` → 1, `≤ max(0, margin−ramp)` → 0);
   the multisplit group arbiter and the farewell sync; every `__post_init__` `ValueError`
   (`pytest.raises(ValueError, match=...)`); safe-degrade holds the last valve.
2. **Simulation (`-m simulation`, seed 12345):** a session-scoped `run_scenario` harness returning
   `(SimulationLog, SimMetrics)`; parametrized scenarios calling `assert_*` per room.
3. **Off-by-default on the live system** *(historical: the dedicated `shadow` dry-run stage was
   removed 2026-07-12, v0.7.0 — Aneks §8.12 / DECISIONS §13)*: a new room starts `off` and the
   coordinator emits no commands until its control state is switched to `live`.

### 10.3 Scenario library and acceptance metrics

`scenarios.py` factory functions + `SCENARIO_LIBRARY` registry:
`steady_heating`, `cold_snap`, `solar_overshoot`, `spring_transition` (transitional),
`hot_july_floor_cooling` (high humidity → exercises both dew-point layers), `sensor_dropout`.
`building_profiles.py`: `modern_bungalow()` (parterowy, ~13 UFH loops, HP ~4.9 kW, ~7 cm screed,
lat 50.5 / lon 19.5) + parametric single-room variants (`well_insulated`, `leaky_old_house`,
`thin_screed`, `heavy_construction`).

`metrics.SimMetrics.from_log` (single deterministic pass) + assertion helpers (raise
`AssertionError` with diagnostics): `assert_comfort`, `assert_floor_temp_safe(max_temp=34.0)`,
`assert_no_condensation(margin=2.0)`, `assert_no_freezing(hard_min=16.0)`,
`assert_no_prolonged_cold`. Split-specific pump-ahead assertions are dropped. A known-fail control
case (e.g. a badly under-powered leaky house in a cold snap) is wrapped in `pytest.raises`.

Acceptance targets: `steady_heating` → comfort > 95 %, split never engages; `cold_snap` →
`T_room ≥ setpoint − 1.5 K` + recovery overshoot ≤ 0.5 K from 12 h after the step (K8);
`hot_july_floor_cooling` → zero condensation events, valves genuinely open (> 60 % of records
after K6); `night_setback` (K1) → bounded heating-above-band integral, prompt post-setback
close, bounded sag.

**kt measurement note (K2, 2026-07-12; DECISIONS §11):** after honest attempts no scenario on
the calibrated twin measurably contrasts `kt = 12` vs `kt = 0` (every peak-overshoot delta
≤ 0.03 K — solar gains dominate with valves closed; the anti-overshoot of the defaults is
carried by the small `ki` and, since K1, the bumpless transfer + unwind). `kt` stays per the
frozen trend-member decision; the trend term's SIGN and magnitude are pinned by a unit canary
(`trend_term == −kt · filtered_trend`, damping only on approach), because a sign regression
would pass the whole simulation gate unnoticed.

---

## 11. Out of scope for v1

MPC / horizon optimisation / dynamic tariffs; online RC identification / model learning; heat-pump
and water-side control; a physical slab sensor; recuperator / CO₂ / free-cooling; CWU (DHW)
scheduling. (Floor cooling was moved *into* v1 — Aneks §8.4.) The trend-damping term deliberately
substitutes for the anticipatory value MPC would provide, at a fraction of the complexity.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-07-08 | Created from BUILD_SPEC + PRD Aneks §8 + `CONTROL_ALGORITHMS_REVIEW.md`; mirrors real `controller.py` / `pid.py` / `dew_point.py` signatures. |
| 2026-07-09 | Aligned with v0.3.x code: vendored-core paths; measured `dt_seconds` (coordinator clamp [1, 900] s) now drives ALL time-dependent terms — the PI integral included (`compute(..., dt_seconds=...)`, fixing double integration on debounced recomputes) — alongside trend and dwell; cooling opt-out early return; safety override + additive report stamping (`dew_excluded_reason` via `classify_dew_eligibility`, `fast_dwell_remaining_s`, `room_temperature_c`); directional feedforward formula; degradation-table rows (mode-aware sensor-lost hold, `cooling_disabled`, `fast_source_cannot_cool`). |
| 2026-07-09 | Phase A safety hardening (DECISIONS §6): sensor-lost safe-degrade is mode-dependent (COOLING parks the valve at 0, never freeze-open; HEATING keeps the freeze); the safety override decides the water side and the air side independently (S1/S2 close the valve without silencing an active S3/S4 fast source), syncs the fast-source dwell machine on force-ON, and never poisons the sensor-lost hold (`_last_valve_pct` keeps the last healthy position). Adapter: room-temperature plausibility gate (−10..50 °C, > 4 K/cycle held for a 2-sample confirmation), state-age gate (temp 45 min / RH 60 min ⇒ unavailable), per-loop valve-feedback validation + `valve_mismatch` flag, farewell command on live→shadow/off + unload, persisted global mode. |
| 2026-07-09 | Phase B fast-source direction machine (DECISIONS §7): three-state `OFF/HEATING/COOLING` machine — direction change only through OFF with the full min-OFF, min-ON hold re-emits the REMEMBERED direction (`_fallback_mode` deleted); physical `fast_source_on` consumed (first feedback wins, conservative 0-seeded dwell after restart, `fast_source_mismatch` flag); split targets `setpoint ± 1 K` in active modes (S12) and exactly `setpoint` in TRANSITIONAL with far-edge release (bias removed); adapter split-command cache + ~45 min re-assert (S3); `boost_offset_c > deadband_c` validation (D2); dwell accumulates on sensor-lost/OFF paths (fast-F6). |
| 2026-07-09 | Phases C+D+E (DECISIONS §8): retuned defaults kp=14/ki=0.0015/kt=12 (empirical sweep on the CALIBRATED twin; old ki=0.02 measured +1.2 K overshoot); FILTERED trend (>= 60 s sample floor + 15 min EMA); integrator frozen under an active S2 throttle, reset on HEATING<->COOLING, decayed after > 12 h inactivity; saturated no longer set by an S2 zero; FF constants -> ControllerConfig knobs; S5 watchdog LIVE (adapter-fed per-room data age, neutral-position action); BuildingOutputs.sensor_lost_rooms; simulator: solar wired (f_slab row), seasonal ground, EN 1264^1.1 plant with screed resistance, indoor-humidity model, cooling supply floored by the global safe dew point, split_boost scenario, ALL scenarios gate the merge with the S13 overshoot assertion. |
| 2026-07-12 | Round-2 review (DECISIONS §11): K1 bumpless setpoint transfer (`shift_integral(kp·dK)`, mode-correct sign) + asymmetric integrator unwind (`unwind_factor = 8`) with the `night_setback` gate scenario (`SimScenario.setpoint_schedule`); K6 margin de-stacking — the local throttle ramp ENDS at `dew_margin_k` (full cooling on the pump's dew floor; hard S2 at the dew point itself); K3 CLOSE_VALVE is water-side only (the air-side decision stands); K4 multisplit group arbiter (`fast_source_group`, one direction per aggregate, direction-aware S4 mismatch via `fast_source_hvac_mode`); K5 mode-aware `controller_error` degrade; K7 two-stage RH staleness (+1 K dew pad, `rh_stale_gated`); K8 cold-snap recovery assertion; K9 throttle-freeze retained (back-calc from the final valve measured and rejected); K10 farewell syncs the fast machine; flag split `s2_throttle` vs `s2_condensation`; write threshold 2 → 5 pp; kt documented as an open question with data (unit sign canary). |
| 2026-07-12 | Round-3 hardening (DECISIONS §12, v0.6.1): group arbiter grew the incumbent hysteresis (§8.4 — challenger wins only beyond +0.5 K over the incumbent; largest-excess tie-break documented) and the adapter stopped SHADOW rooms from voting (`fast_source_group` emptied for non-LIVE rooms); PID `shift_integral` banks the clamp-cut as a signed residual netted against opposite shifts, and the back-calculation is suppressed while an opposite-sign residual is outstanding — a setpoint wiggle at a small integral is idempotent (was: pumped to ~2·kp·ΔK); the RH staleness pad is linear (`humidity_stale_frac` 0 → 1 over 60-120 min, `frac * 1 K`; the unavailable-entity cache branch reads as fully stale). Adapter lifecycle: coordinator shutdown + Store flush BEFORE the unload farewell, `_parked` write gate, LOADED-entry filter in WS/services, non-finite setpoint guard, hub device registered before platforms. |
| 2026-07-12 | Shadow removal (DECISIONS §13, v0.7.0): the per-room control state is a two-state `off` / `live`; `off` is the default for new/unknown rooms; migration v2→v3 maps `shadow` (and garbage) to `off` (v1→v3 chain in one call). Core untouched (it never knew shadow — only `Mode` + the farewell hook); K1 reduces to "an OFF room does not vote" with the emptied `fast_source_group` kept as belt-and-braces. |
| 2026-07-12 | Quiet hours + heat-pump link (DECISIONS §14, v0.8.0): per-room fast-source allowed-window (`RoomInputs.fast_source_allowed`, adapter computes the bool from the HA clock, pure `window_allows` in the core; crosses midnight; S3/S4 emergency overrides silence); opt-in heat-pump link (`core/hp_link.py`: direction sync always preserving `+DHW`, `max(cooling_supply_base_c, safe dew)` cooling water, optional heating curve). |
| 2026-07-13 | Hydraulic no-flow watchdog S6 + write-path fixes (DECISIONS §15, v0.9.0): loop supply/return probes as an independent witness of actuation (never trusts valve feedback — it can echo); `loop_no_flow` (freeze integrator); circulation-evidence gating (other-loop ΔT or `entity_global_supply`); manual `test_actuation` service; valve re-assert (~45 min + feedback-divergence) at parity with the splits; simulator fault injection for the echoing/frozen actuator. New flow-watchdog knobs (see DECISIONS §15 body). |
| 2026-07-13 | Stuck-open reverse detection removed (DECISIONS §17, supersedes §16, v0.11.0): the closed-valve-leaking flag (proposed §15, reworked to a room-air witness §16) is withdrawn — room temperature versus setpoint cannot hard-verify actuation, so it produced only false alarms. `loop_no_flow`, the actuation self-test and the flow-watchdog knobs are unchanged; hard close-and-measure verification is deferred to a future mechanism. |
| 2026-07-14 | Cooling floor-valve boost hold (DECISIONS §18, v0.11.0): when the split is engaged in COOLING the floor valve holds its pre-boost position (`valve = max(valve, snapshot)`, snapshot taken before the S2 dew throttle) instead of collapsing to 0 as the split cools the air out from under the air-error PI — so the slab keeps discharging. Only mechanism #1 shipped; the integrator freeze (#2) and trend-damper suppression (#3) from the design were evaluated on the twin and dropped as redundant (the `max()` already dominates, and the integrator does not discharge). No new knob, no contract change; safety still wins over the hold (sensor-lost parks at 0, the dew throttle scales the held value, `dew_factor=0` closes). |
